# test_of_googletest
A test of googletest.

Google test is a good tool for the testing of software.

Testcases can be defined in a source code file.
Each testcase starts with *ASSERT_* or *EXPECT_*. After
the underscore there is a *EQ* for equal or a *NE* for
not equal.
While *ASSERT* stops the testing (maybe after an failed
comparisions of vector lengths), the other tests are
executed with *EXPECT*.
